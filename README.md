# ATSAMD21 Prototype board

This is a first prototype of a simple, debuggable, Arduino-Nano-ish development board. It's unlikely to be useful to anyone, it's just a proving ground for building more useful boards in future revisions once this one is shown to work.

For an actual development board, I'd recommend buying Adafruit's Feather M0 Express. The MCU package in this eagle file is taken from that board.
